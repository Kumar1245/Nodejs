// what is event ?
// Answer : An event is an action or occurrence that happens in the system, such as a user clicking a button, a file being read, or a network request completing.

// what is event loop ?
// Answer : The event loop is a programming construct that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program. It allows non-blocking I/O operations by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.

// Single Callable Event:
// Answer : A single callable event refers to an event that can be triggered or invoked only once during its lifecycle. After it has been called, it cannot be called again. This is often used in scenarios where an action should only occur a single time, such as initializing a resource or handling a one-time user interaction.

// Multiple Callable Event:
// Answer : A multiple callable event refers to an event that can be triggered or invoked multiple times during its lifecycle. This allows the same event to be handled repeatedly, which is useful for scenarios like responding to user actions (e.g., button clicks) or handling recurring system events (e.g., data updates).
